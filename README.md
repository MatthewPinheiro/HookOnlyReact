This is my own, ~100 line implementation of some of the more core parts of React (notably hooks and the render lifecycle needed to power them). Purely for illustrative purposes, in case you want an easier way to understand how and why hooks work without combing through the actual React src. 

Only implements the 2 most fundamental hooks (useState and useEffect). The example file also contains a custom hook to show how these concepts build on top of one another. No DOM and no child support in JSX. 

Run `example.js` to see it in action.
